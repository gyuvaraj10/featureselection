1. Filter Method: Selecting the best subset of features using Chi Square, ANOVA Test, Correlation Coefficient
2. Wrapper Method (use only when the dataset is very small): 1. Forward Selection (selects best important features) 2. Backward elimination (Perform Statistical test such as Chi Square Test) 3. Recursive Feature Elimination: Greedy Optimization Algorithm
3. Embedded Methods:

We use the below methods in general to select the features
1. Univariate Selection: https://youtu.be/EqLBAmtKMnQ?t=716
2. Feature Importance
3. Correlation Matrix with HeatMap
